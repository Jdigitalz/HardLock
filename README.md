## Future planning

 - Create a proper GUI for HardLock 
 - Make HardLock look better in the CLI
 - Add the ability to store files in a feature called 'Vault'
 - Create a way to send HardLock to other instances of HardLock

## Disclaimer
This program is not perfect, but I did try my best to make it as secure as possible for actual use. You should probably use something like KeePass as a password manager instead. This program does, for the most part, encrypt your data and protect it from deletion by requiring sudo permissions to view.
