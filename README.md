 - Create a proper GUI for HardLock

## Disclaimer
 This program is not perfect, But is did try my best to make it as secure as possible for actual use. You should probably use something like XKeypass as a password manager instead. This program does for the most part encrypt your data and protect from deletion by requiring sudo permissions to view.
